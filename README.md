### Bio
I am a passionate graphic designer, animator, and digital content creator from Nairobi, Kenya, driven by a commitment to using media and leadership skills for positive social impact. My academic journey started at Multimedia University of Kenya, where I earned my undergraduate degree in Broadcast Journalism. My strong media skills allowed me to offer my services to both mainstream media outlets and advertising agencies. Later, I attended Tangaza University, where I studied for a Bachelor's degree in Leadership and Management, majoring in Public Administration. 
Currently, I am working as the communication director at the Congregation of the Mission Vice Province of Kenya. In this role, I write, develop, and design a monthly newsletter, producing and managing the website and social media channels for the six(6) parishes in Kenya and the international spectrum, which reinforces my dedication to using media and leadership skills to support the needy and vulnerable in society. 
In addition, I am the chairperson and one of the founders of my high school alumni association, Olympic High School Alumni Association, in Kibera, Nairobi which was established in 2018, giving back to my roots. My journey in leadership started during my high school tenure, where I served as school president then later at Multimedia University, where I served as student delegate. I furthered my leadership skills by serving as Academic Secretary in the student council at Tangaza University. Despite graduating from Tangaza University, volunteer as the communication person of the faculty scholarship program, the Center of Leadership and Management Scholarship, supporting quality education initiatives. 
Outside the corporate world, I am the founder and Chief Executive of Mediapot Solution, located in Kajiado County. It offers cyber services, internet connectivity to the residents and AI and computer packages training center targeting high school graduates.
