I am a journalism graduate from the Multimedia University of Kenya with a Bachelor’s Degree in Broadcast Journalism. Currently, I am working at the Congregation of the Mission, Vice-Province of Kenya as Communication Director. I have previously worked at Dentsu Kenya and Standard Group Limited media house in the journalism department. These placements have allowed me to develop knowledge in the media sector, gain hands-on experience, and expand transferable skills such as investigative journalism, photography, videography, graphics design, and good communication. I furthered my studies at Tangaza University, where I pursued a Bachelor's of Leadership and Management. My career aim is to gain a role that allows me to further my experience and skills.
